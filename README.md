# Data Science and AI Projects

This repository showcases a small collection of concise yet powerful examples of data science and machine learning implemented in Python. Each script is self contained and demonstrates a complete workflow—loading data, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation—with clear documentation in the source code.

## Projects

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`iris_classification.py`** | A tutorial‑style script that trains and evaluates Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on the classic Iris flower dataset. It reports accuracy and a detailed classification report for each model. |
| **`digits_classification.py`** | A compact example of multiclass classification on the handwritten digits dataset using Logistic Regression. The script scales features, trains the model, and prints out accuracy and the classification report. |

## Getting Started

To run these examples locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository** (or download the files).
2. **Install the required packages**. You can install dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit‑learn pandas
   ```

3. **Run a script** by executing it with Python. For example:

   ```bash
   python iris_classification.py
   ```

   Each script will print out evaluation metrics to the console.

## About

These mini projects are designed to be accessible for beginners and to serve as a starting point for more advanced experiments. Feel free to expand upon them by adding data visualizations, trying different algorithms, or exploring other datasets. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
